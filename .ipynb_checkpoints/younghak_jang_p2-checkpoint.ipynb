    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "k-nearest neighbor in sklearn uses Minkowski distance metric, which is an n-dimensional version of Euclidean distance, as the default distance metric. So applying this metric into vectors from CountVectorizer makes serious problem because,\n",
    "* if a certain word appear in a document once and many times in another they are considered far away from each other, while\n",
    "* if there exists a document that has only one word that happen to be the next word in the vocabulary, they are considered close to each other even if the next word doesn't have any relationship with the previous word.\n",

    "* Doc 1: 'word'\n",
    "* Doc 2: 'word word word word'\n",
    "* Doc 3: 'letter'\n",
    "\n",
    "Minkowski distance metric will say that Doc 3 is closer to Doc1 than Doc2, but intuitively Doc1 and Doc2 have higher probability of having the same label than Doc1 and Doc3. So k-nearest neighbor shouldn't work as well as other algorithms that puts no meaning in adjacency of words in the vocabulary.\n",

That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
